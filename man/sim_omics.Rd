}
\arguments{
\item{b1t2}{Numeric value that both theta2 (\code{"t2"}) and beta1 (\code{"b1"}) take for non-null mediators.}

\item{t1}{Numeric value of theta2 i.e. the effect of the exposure on the outcome.}

\item{nsamp}{Number of samples.}

\item{ngene}{Number of genes other than that of primary interest to simulate.}

\item{FDR}{FDR threshold to apply.}

\item{rho}{Inter-gene correlation coefficients.}

\item{prop.consistent}{Proportion of genes that are consistent mediators. Must be at least \code{1/ngene}.}

\item{prop.inconsistent}{Proportion of genes that are inconsistent mediators.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reprodubility.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; should the number of simulations be printed every 100 simulations?}
}
\value{
Matrix with proportion of significant calls for every method for true and null mediators.
