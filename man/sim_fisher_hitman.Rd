\title{Apply Fisher test to simulated data analyzed by \code{hitman}}
\usage{
sim_fisher_hitman(G, E, all.feats, effect.v = c(0, 0.2), alpha = 0.05,
  nsim = 99, prop.other.sig = 0.01, seed = 1, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{Gene set list as returned from \code{\link{read_gmt}}.}

\item{E}{A numeric vector of exposures.}

\item{all.feats}{All feature names. Must overlap with \code{G}.}

\item{effect.v}{Numeric vector of log fold-changes or percent of phentotypes to add.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha level.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations.}

\item{prop.other.sig}{Proportion of genes outside set to have signal added.}

\item{seed}{Integer seed to set for reproducility if \code{fun="mroast"}, since \code{mroast} uses random 
simulations. Ignored if \code{fun="fry"}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; should the number of simulations be printed every 100 simulations?}
}
