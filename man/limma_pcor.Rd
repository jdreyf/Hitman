\usage{
limma_pcor(object, phenotype, covariates, reorder.rows = TRUE,
  prefix = NULL, adjust.method = "BH", check.names = TRUE,
  cols = c("t", "P.Value"))
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Matrix-like data object containing log-ratios or log-expression values, with rows corresponding to 
features (e.g. genes) and columns to samples. Must have rownames that are non-duplicated and non-empty.}

\item{phenotype}{Numeric vector of sample characteristics (e.g. phenotypes or treatments). 
Should be same length as \code{ncol(object)}.}

\item{covariates}{Numeric vector with one element per sample or matrix-like object with rows corresponding
to samples and columns to covariates to be adjusted for.}

\item{reorder.rows}{Logical, should rows be reordered by p-value?}

\item{prefix}{Character string to add to beginning of column names. \code{NULL} does not add a prefix.}

\item{adjust.method}{Method used to adjust the p-values for multiple testing. Options, in increasing conservatism, 
include \code{"none"}, \code{"BH"}, \code{"BY"}, and \code{"holm"}. See \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}} for the complete
list of options. A \code{NULL} value will result in the default adjustment method, which is \code{"BH"}.}

\item{check.names}{Logical; should \code{names(phenotype)==rownames(object)} be checked?}

\item{cols}{Columns of \code{topTable} output to include. Possibilities include \code{"logFC", "AveExpr", "t", "P.Value",
"adj.P.Val", "B"}. Some of these column names are then changed here. If \code{logFC} is specified, \code{FC} will 
automatically also be given.}
